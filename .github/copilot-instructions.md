# Copilot Instructions

When generating code, avoid adding comments unless explicitly requested.

Always use yarn instead of npm for package installations.

Prefer concise code without unnecessary explanatory comments.

When suggesting package installations, always use 'yarn add' instead of 'npm install'.
